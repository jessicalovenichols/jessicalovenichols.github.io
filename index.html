	<p>Hi! I’m a graduate student in linguistics at the <a href = http://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu>University of California, Santa Barbara</a>. 
        My primary research interest is in the relationship of language and identity to environmental conservation. 
        I also study language and identity in related areas—international development, media personae, and language and education.</p>
