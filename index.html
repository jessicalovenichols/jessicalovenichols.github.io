	<p>Hi! I’m a graduate student in linguistics at the <a href = http://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu>University of California, Santa Barbara</a>. 
        My primary research interest is in the relationship of language and identity to environmental conservation. 
        I also study language and identity in related areas—international development, media personae, and language and education.</p>
	<p>I also get to work with the <a href = http://mixteco.org/tequio/>Tequio Youth group</a> at the <a href = http://mixteco.org>Mixteco Indígena Community Organizing Project</a> 
		in their work to promote language maintenance.  To that end, we created a short documentary called 
		<a href = https://jessicalovenichols.github.io/teaching/#Tequio>Orgullosamente indígena</a> about the experiences of 
		youth speakers of indigenous languages.</p>
