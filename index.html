	<p>Hi! I’m a Visiting Assistant professor at <a href = https://www.macalester.edu/linguistics>Macalester College</a>. I'm 
		sociocultural linguist and linguistic anthropologist. My research focuses on gender, class, and 
		regional identities—how people position themselves and others linguistically and ideologically—as well as how 
		these identities interact with other ideologies. My primary research interest is in the relationship of language and 
		identity to environmental conservation. I also study language and identity in related areas—international development, 
		media personae, and language and education.
		
		I received my PhD and MA from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and my BA from Reed College in 2008.
		
		This year I'm teaching Phonology (Fall 2019), Introduction to Linguistics (Spring 2020), and Language and 
		Climate Change (Spring 2020).</p>
