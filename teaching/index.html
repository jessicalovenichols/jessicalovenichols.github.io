	<h1>Teaching</h1>
  <p>I love teaching languages and linguistics. At the college level, 
	  I’ve had the opportunity to teach:</p>
	<p>As a primary instructor:</p>

<li>LING 133: Language, Gender and Sexuality</li>
<li>SPAN 1: Elementary Spanish</li>
	
	<p>As a teaching assistant:</p>
<li>LING 20: Introduction to Linguistics</li>
<li>LING 50: Language and Power</li>
<li>LING 187: Language, Power, and Learning</li>
<li>LING 70: Language and Society</li>

<p>I’ve also taught sociolinguistics to youth in 
	Santa Barbara and Ventura counties through the outreach program <a href = http://www.skills.ucsb.edu>SKILLS</a>.</P>
<p>During the SKILLS program, the Tequio Youth created a short documentary and a series of podcasts to 
	promote the maintenance of Mixtec and Zapotec.</p>
