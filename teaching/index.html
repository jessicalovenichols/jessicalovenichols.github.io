	<h1>Teaching</h1>
  <p>Teaching languages and linguistics is one of my favorite parts of being in academia. At the college level, 
	  I’ve had the opportunity to teach:</p>

	<li>LING 133: Language, Gender and Sexuality</li>
<li>LING 20: Introduction to Linguistics</li>
<li>LING 50: Language and Power</li>
<li>LING 187: Language, Power, and Learning</li>
<li>LING 70: Language and Society</li>
<li>SPAN 1: Elementary Spanish</li>

<p>I’ve also taught sociolinguistics to high schoolers for three through the outreach program SKILLS (link)</P>

<h2>Before grad school</h2>

<p>Before grad school, I also taught in a variety of contexts, including:</p>

<li>As a TESOL volunteer instructor for the Portland Immigrant and Refugee Community Organization.</li>

<li>As a first grade teacher at Community School 66 from 2008-2010.</li>
