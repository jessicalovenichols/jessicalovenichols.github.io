  <p>Originally from Colorado, I’ve lived for brief stints in Oregon, New York, Nicaragua, and California. </p>
	<p> Before starting grad school, I worked as a first grade teacher for a couple years in New York City 
		and served as an Environmental Educator with the Peace Corps in Nicaragua</p>
	 <p> When I’m not linguist-ing, I enjoy rock climbing and admiring mountains around the world.</p>
